This is Homework 1


HTML
I tried really hard to not ADD or CHANGE the appearance of the website in the browser.

With the HTML, I changed a lot of classes over to IDs to make it easier to indentify elements.

I used CLASSES so that I could consolidate shared styles between elements resulting in LESS CSS. 

I also added some semantic tags around div elements. (not sure if you can take these div elements out and replace with semantic tags?) 

My objective here was to refactor the code to  make it more clean and concise.


CSS

At some point I got comnpletely in the zone and things started making sense and lost track of what changes I made. 

In essence, I tried my best consolidate the CSS so that classes could consolidate styles that were shared and made 
IDs to specify certain types of content to make the CSS itself more accessible. 

I also tried NOT to change the appearance of the website in the
browser and instead focused on making everything clean, concise and free of all unneccesary code
